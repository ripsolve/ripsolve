//! Branching variable selection.
//!
//! Pseudocost scoring is the default and is a clear win: on v081c162n018 it takes
//! 3828 nodes where most-fractional branching took 14602.
//!
//! # Strong branching, and why it is off
//!
//! Strong branching probes a column by actually solving both child LPs. It is
//! implemented here and defaults to **off**, but the reason changed once the search
//! around it changed, and the history is worth keeping because the first
//! explanation was wrong.
//!
//! Under depth-first node selection it was catastrophic — v128c256n100 went from 10
//! nodes to 917, v081c162n018 from 3828 to 23686. The suspicion at the time was
//! that these instances are dual degenerate enough that most probes return a zero
//! degradation, leaving the score to break ties arbitrarily.
//!
//! That was measured and is false. Instrumenting the probe outcomes shows *every*
//! probe returning a finite, strictly positive degradation: zero of them come back
//! degenerate, truncated, or infeasible. The probes were always informative.
//!
//! The real cause was the interaction with depth-first selection. Under a plunge a
//! branching decision compounds: the search descends into whichever subtree the
//! rule chose and stays there, so any change to the rule swings the tree enormously
//! and a locally better decision can be globally much worse. Best-bound selection
//! is self-correcting, because the next node comes from the global pool regardless
//! of what the last decision was. Re-measured under best-bound, strong branching
//! reduces node counts on seven of eight instances, by 10% to 32%.
//!
//! It stays off because the node savings do not pay for the probes: two extra LPs
//! per candidate costs more wall-clock time than 10-30% fewer nodes saves, on five
//! of eight instances. Worth enabling on large models — v128c1000n100 goes from
//! 13.3s to 9.5s at a budget of 100 — which is what the budget option is for.
