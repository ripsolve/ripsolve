//! A bounded-variable revised primal simplex, with a phase-1 for feasibility.
//!
//! # Computational form
//!
//! The model's range rows are turned into equalities by giving every row a logical
//! (slack) variable:
//!
//! ```text
//!   min  c'z    subject to    [A | -I] z = 0,    l <= z <= u
//! ```
//!
//! where `z = [x; s]` puts the `n` structural variables first and the `m` logicals
//! after. A logical carries its row's bounds, so `<=`, `>=`, `=` and range rows all
//! reduce to a bound pair and the simplex never branches on row sense. Structural
//! bounds start at `[0, 1]`; branching later narrows them to `[0,0]` or `[1,1]`.
//!
//! The starting basis is all-logical, whose matrix is `-I`, trivially invertible,
//! and generally primal infeasible, which is what phase 1 is for.
//!
//! # Phase 1
//!
//! Phase 1 minimizes the sum of bound violations of the basic variables. Its
//! gradient is `-1` for a basic below its lower bound and `+1` for one above its
//! upper bound, and zero elsewhere; nonbasic variables sit on a bound and so never
//! contribute. The ratio test stops at the first breakpoint, the first basic
//! variable to reach a bound, whether it is becoming feasible or losing
//! feasibility. That is the textbook short-step rule: monotone and easy to verify,
//! but it takes more iterations than the long-step piecewise test a mature solver
//! uses. Replacing it is an M1b concern, not a correctness one.
