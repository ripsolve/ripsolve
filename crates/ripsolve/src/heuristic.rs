//! Primal heuristics: find good feasible solutions early.
//!
//! Branch and bound prunes by comparing a node's bound against the best solution
//! found so far, so it cannot prune anything at all until it holds one. A search
//! that spends its first thousand nodes without an incumbent is doing exhaustive
//! work no matter how good its bound is, which is exactly what `v064c1000n020`
//! did, running out its time limit having never found a feasible point.
//!
//! Two heuristics, cheapest first:
//!
//! - **Rounding.** Round the relaxation and test it. Costs one pass over the rows
//!   and no LP at all, and on models whose relaxation is nearly integral it simply
//!   works.
//! - **Diving.** Repeatedly fix the *least* fractional column to its nearest
//!   integer and re-solve, until the relaxation comes out integral or the dive
//!   hits infeasibility. Each re-solve differs from the last by one bound, so the
//!   warm-started dual simplex settles it in a handful of pivots, the same
//!   machinery the search itself runs on.
//!
//! Least fractional, not most: the aim here is a feasible point rather than a
//! strong bound, so the column already closest to deciding itself is the one whose
//! rounding is least likely to make the LP infeasible. Branching wants the
//! opposite, which is why it scores columns by pseudocost instead.
//!
//! A feasibility pump would be the next addition, for models where diving keeps
//! hitting infeasibility. It is a genuinely different mechanism, alternating
//! projection and rounding, rather than a refinement of this one.
